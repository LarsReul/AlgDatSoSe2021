# AlgDat

Supplemental material for lecture Algorithms and Data Structures

What can you do with the different variants?

- Play around with the algorithms and data structures
- Get statistics about the behavior
- Look at the visualization

Feel free to modify the code to obtain the information you want to have like

- other data
- more statistics
- other visualizations
- ...

Playing around with the code helps to understand the algorithms and data structures.
